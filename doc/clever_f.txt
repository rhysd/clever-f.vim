INTRODUCTION                                       *clever-f.vim-introduction*

*clever-f.vim* or *clever-f* extends |f| mapping for more convenience.
You can forget the existence of |;|.

I'll show an example of usage. _ is the place of cursor, -> is a move of
cursor, alphabets above -> is input by keyboard.

                                 *g:clever_f_not_overwrites_standard_mappings*
If you don't set |g:clever_f_not_overwrites_standard_mappings|, |clever-f|
replaces |f|, |F|, |t|, and |T| with |<Plug>(clever-f)|, |<Plug>(clever-F)|,
|<Plug>(clever-t)| and |<Plug>(clever-T)| as default mappings.

<Plug>(clever-f)                    *<Plug>(clever-f)*
<Plug>(clever-F)                    *<Plug>(clever-F)*
<Plug>(clever-t)                    *<Plug>(clever-t)*
<Plug>(clever-T)                    *<Plug>(clever-T)*
